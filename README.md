## Elements of Programming Interviews

Here are my solutions to problems I consider relevant from [*Elements of Programming Interviews*](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272/ref=sr_1_1) by Aziz, Lee, and Prakash.

To run a solution on your Windows machine &ndash;

* Open your command prompt (`Windows key`, type "cmd", `Enter`).
* Install [Scoop](https://scoop.sh).
* Use Scoop to install Java.
* Clone this repository.
* Enter "run" followed by part of the filename (e.g. `run MergeTwoSortedLists`).
